ULYSSES S. GRANT
Early Life
Born in Point Pleasant, Ohio on April 27, 1822

Civil War
Appointed by governor of Illinois to lead a new volunteer regiment, then promoted to brigadier general

Election
1868 - Ran against Horatio Seymour, the Democratic governor of New York - his running mate was the speaker of the House, Schuyler Colfax. He won the electoral college in a landslide.
One of the first elections where the vote of southern freedmen greatly helped the Republican candidate win
1872 - Grant ran against Horace Greeley, who was nominated by both the Democratic and Liberal Republican parties - again a huge electoral college victory
The Liberal Republicans were a faction of the Republican party that split off before the election to oppose some of his policies of continued reconstruction
Presidency
The Grant administration was known for its many scandals, such as:
Credit Mobilier Scandal - Union Pacific Railroad Company created Credit Mobilier as a fake company to make more money off government subsidies
Company gave shares to congressmen to prevent an investigation in 1867
Around the election of 1872, the story broke, and and investigation started 
Important congressmen investigated included Vice President Schuyler Colfax and future President Rutherford B Hayes
Colfax was taken off 1872 ballot for VP for his involvement, replaced by Henry Wilson
Whiskey Ring Scandal - Members of Department of Treasury and a group of distillers cheated government out of excise tax on whiskey by filing false reports
One of Grant’s secretary, Orville Babcock, along with various other government officials, were investigated. Babcock had to leave his position

Indian Ring Scandal  - Secretary of War William W Belknap accepted bribes to keep an Indian post trader in office

When Grant figured out what was going on, he and his treasury secretary ordered the sale of $4million in gold in 1869, crashing the price of gold

Under Klan act, which provided for the jailing of those who tried to deprive citizens of equal protection, many suspected Klansmen were jailed
Led to decreased Klan violence in the early 1870’s
Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas are readmitted to UNion during Grant administration
Only states required to ratify Fifteenth Amendment for admission
Civil Rights act of 1875
Guaranteed african Americans equal rights in public places but not well enforced
“Crime of ‘73”
A coinage act passed in 1873 that ended silver as a basis of currency, was not originally hated but came to be so over the next twenty five years
Panic of 1873
Economy was weakened by effects of Civil War, a European financial crisis, and overexpansion of railroads - fell into panic in 1873
Immediate cause of Panic was failure of various Wall Street investment firms, the first of which was Jay Cooke and Company
Caused one of the biggest U.S depressions up to that point
Indian Policy and Indian Wars
Grant was progressive in dealing with Indian affairs, introduced a “PEace Policy” with regard to Native Americans
 New Board of Indian Commissioners was created, but Grant’s policies were not very effective in the long run
Whites continued conflict with Native Americans - notably at the Battle of Little Bighorn with General Custer, who was defeated by Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull
Alabama Claims
Confederate ships, including the Alabama, had been constructed in England
The people of the US and the gov’t demanded it be compensated by England for the damage caused by these ships
Secretary of State Hamilton Fish forged out the Treaty of Washington with the British, compensating %15.5 million to the America
Specie Resumption Act
Provided that starting in 1879, old “greenbacks” could be redeemed for new money on the gold standard, meant to place all currency on specie

A special electoral commision was formed, which had a 8 to 7 republican leaning, to resolve the disputed votes. They awarded all 20 to hayes, giving him a majority
Democrats disapproved of the questionable awarding of votes - they negotiated with the new Administration and agreed that the government would remove troops from the south, give the south funding for a railroad and infrastructure, and put a southerner on the cabinet

After  pro-Spanish riots in early 1898, the American Battleship Maine was sent to the Havana harbor to protect relation with the Spanish and protect U.S citizens
In February, the Maine exploded, killing 266, causing many Americans to blame the Spanish and rally for war
In reality the explosion was probably caused by a technical malfunction
After diplomacy failed, Spain declared war on April 23 and the U.S declared war on the 25th

Causes of the Great Depression
Long term causes - Effects of World War II, Rapid Stock market growth, overproduction, wealth gap
Effects of World War II - Germany was in HUGE debts to the allied countries, had to get loans from U.S to pay them off - European economy becomes partly dependent on U.S dollar, U.S economy weakened slightly
Rapid Stock Market Growth - More and more American put their money in the stock market in the 1920’s which caused rapid growth and thus destabilization - index of industrial stock tripled between 1925 and 1929
Overproduction - The agricultural industry began a period of overproduction in WW1, which weakened value of products and thus the industry began to fail
Wealth Gap - The economy grew during the 1920’s, but only the wealthy experienced rapid growth - top 5 percent of the wealthy owned a third of the wealth by 1929
Stock market crash of 1929 - “Black Thursday” and “Black Tuesday”
“Black Thursday” - October 18, 1929 - After weeks of decline, a panic in the NEw York Stock exchange set in and resulted in the record trading of 12 million stocks - greatly destabilized, but did not break, stock market
“Black Tuesday” - October 24, 1929 - Price of stock fell dramatically and over 16 million stocks were traded, resulting in the collapse of the stock market and loss of billions of dollars
Not the single cause of the depression - more like a ‘spark’ lighting a fire to which much more fuel would be added
Programs created in attempt to fix economic crisis
PECE - Presidential Emergency Committee on Employment, created by Hoover in 1930 to help fight unemployment by opening up federal public works projects
Replaced by a similar committee, The President’s Organization for Unemployment Relief, or POUR, in 1931
Emergency Relief Construction Act - Passed in 1932, directed billions of federal dollars to creating public works projects and supporting relief efforts
National Credit Corporation, or NCC was created in 1931 to help small banks, ineffective and ran out of money quickly
Replaced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or RFC, which was slightly more successful but not on a universal scale
America during the Depression
Bank Failures - Banks closed in waves starting in the fall of 1930, by the end of Hoover's administration over 5,000 had closed nationwide
Unemployment - In 1928, only about 5 percent of the American labor force was unemployed, by 1933, this number had peaked at about 25 percent
Poverty and Hunger - American poverty and homelessness increased rapidly in this period, many had to resort to “Soup Kitchens” to supply all their food
Hoovervilles - Shantytowns that emerged on the outsides of cities and across the countryside, provided dilapidated shacks for the homeless and unemployed, of which there were many
Named after Herbert Hoover as he was almost universally blamed for the depression
Bonus Army - A large group of WWI veterans marched on Washington in summer 1932 demanding congress pay them their bonuses for serving in the war
Bonuses were not supposed to be paid until 1945, congress refused to grant them the payments
General Douglas MacArthur led part of the military to attack the protesting veterans, leading to a public outcry
